Mobile (React Native)

1) Create an Expo app (if you don't already have one):
   npx create-expo-app mobile

2) Replace mobile/App.js with the App.js in this folder.

3) Update mobile/config.js
   Replace YOUR_LOCAL_IP with your computer's IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10)

4) Run the app:
   cd mobile
   npm install
   npx expo start

Note:
- If testing on a phone, your phone and computer must be on the same Wi-Fi.
